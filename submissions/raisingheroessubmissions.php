	<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
		<p>To contribute to this project, please fill out the <a href="">submission form.</a> </p>
	<h3><span id="requirements">The following items will be needed</span></h3>
</header>
	<ul>
		<li><p><span class="submission">Clear Photo</span> of the person whose story you want to tell</p>
		<li><p><span class="submission">story</span>
			<ul>
				<li><p>How did your new friend come to be where they are?</p></li>
				<li><p>How do they feel?</p>
				<li><p>What are their dreams?</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p><span class="submission">Location</span>: Where you met your subject
or a location they often inhabit. This can be as broad as "New Jersey" to as specific as "Wendy's on 2nd and 3rd in New Mexico"</p>
		<li><p><span class="details">details</span>:  Location specificity is appreciated because it helps our goal of enabling people
to open eyes and see these people as humans with stories. This, in turn, may result in people feel more of a connection and like helping.
However, privacy and comfort is of utmost concern and it is understood that some subjects may not want to be approached. Please disclose
location according to your subject's wishes.<br></p>
			<p>If you disclose specific location the person is often at, this may lead to more good samaritans stopping to help.  Be sure this is acceptable your subject before deciding on
which location to submit.
