people to open their eyes and see these people as humans with stories. However, <span id="care">privacy</span> and <span id="care">comfort</span> are of utmost concern.
If you disclose specific location the person is often at, this may lead to more good samaritans stopping to help.  Be sure this is acceptable your subject before deciding on
which location to submit.  Please disclose location according to your subject's wishes.<span id="note">Note</span>  If donations are received, efforts will be made to get some to our friends at their
